              , we've been able to develop and launch ASS after months of
              rigorous testing with Fortune 500 companies who have reported
              "it's definitely one of the storage solutions they've tried."
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              When you sign up for AvgDB, you now get a database with all the
              usual features, plus AvgAuth if you don't know how JWTs work,
              alongisde our great, big, beutiful ASS. What's even cooler is that
              these services integrate seamlessly if you send the correct API
              calls, so you don't need to sign up for yet another vendor just
              for your storage requirements.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our ASS is secure, functional, and comes with our signature
              branding touch. You can use it to store your files, documents,
              images, and more. We've worked our ASS off to make sure it's both
              reliable and affordable.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our Average Storage Service sits behind the same authentication
              system as the rest of AvgDB. Any requests with a valid API key are
              authenticated and passed to the storage API.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We've implemented a secure multi-tenant system where files are
              prefixed with a hash of the API key that created them. This
              ensures that users can only access their own files, preventing any
              cross-account access.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Additionally, we support both public and private files:
            </p>

            <Code block className="mb-4">
              {`# Upload a private file (default)
curl -X POST https://api.averagedatabase.com/yeet \\
  -H "x-averagedb-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.pdf"

# Upload a public file (accessible without API key)
curl -X POST https://api.averagedatabase.com/yeet \\
  -H "x-averagedb-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -F "public=true" \\
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.pdf"`}

              Here's an example of what the API response looks like when
              uploading files:

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              While most enterprise systems are required to retain data for
              extended periods (often 7+ years), we've taken a more efficient
              approach. Files are automatically deleted after 24 hours or when
              total storage exceeds 10GB. This ensures optimal performance and
              keeps our storage costs low, well within our $21.97 budget.
